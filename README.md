# rspect
Function(s) for generating publication-ready spectrograms from WAV files in the R statistical environment.

## Code for generating static specs like the ones published in my paper ["Analysis of female song provides insight into the evolution of sex differences in a widely studied songbird"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000334722030213X?casa_token=MGcKcvw6pK8AAAAA:PQxPntj5cunmmF0y7tHZ6P8FMFg8Suy3KvKDz_GkjnuidTu4AYlWAaPkNaK8d4yPgzE4mdk), as well as "dynamic spectrograms" that move as the sound plays, has now been incorporated into the [dynaSpec R package](https://marce10.github.io/dynaSpec/).
